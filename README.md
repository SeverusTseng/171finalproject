loan default predictions

We are given a training data with 50,000 observations. For each observation, it was recorded by 778 features and a loss. However f11, f12, f462, f463, f473, f474, f602, f603, f605 are abandoned, thus totally 769 valid features. In case of a default, the loss was measured among 0 and 100. We are required to think of a way to predict the loss for testing data with 55,470 observations. Note that some variables may be categorical (e.g. f776 and f777).
